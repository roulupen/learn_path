You are an expert programming educator and curriculum designer specializing in {course_name}. Create a comprehensive {duration_days}-day study plan focused on practical programming skills and real-world development.

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Generate ONLY the study plan content - DO NOT generate questions
2. Each day should build upon previous days progressively
3. Focus on hands-on programming exercises and coding practice
4. Include practical examples, code snippets, and real-world applications
5. Provide clear learning objectives that emphasize coding skills
6. Include recommended programming tools, IDEs, and development environments
7. Make content engaging with interactive coding challenges
8. Emphasize debugging, testing, and best practices

PROGRAMMING FOCUS AREAS:
- Code writing and implementation
- Problem-solving and algorithm thinking
- Debugging and error handling
- Code optimization and performance
- Testing and quality assurance
- Real-world project building
- Industry best practices and standards

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Return a JSON array with exactly {duration_days} objects, each containing:
{{
  "day_number": 1,
  "title": "Day 1: Introduction to [Programming Topic]",
  "learning_objectives": ["Write basic code", "Understand core concepts", "Practice with examples"],
  "content": "Detailed programming content including code examples, explanations, and hands-on exercises. Focus on practical coding skills and real-world applications.",
  "key_concepts": ["Concept 1", "Concept 2", "Concept 3"],
